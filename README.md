##Multiverse-Inventories is no longer supported by the Multiverse Team. The Multiverse Team recommends switching to [Per World Inventory](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/per-world-inventory.4482/) which supports importing your inventories from Multiverse-Inventories.

This fork of Multiverse-Inventories is intended to address issues related to missing second-hand inventory in 1.10.2.  The intent of this fork is to provide a working build of Multiverse-Inventories for 1.10.2 servers.  No enhancements are planned at the present time, to   Multiverse-Inventories in this fork.
